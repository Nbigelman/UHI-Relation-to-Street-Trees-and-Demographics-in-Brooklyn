## The Urban Heat Islandâ€™s Relation to Street Trees and Demographics in Brooklyn

This project aims to research the factors contributing to the urban heat island phenomenon in Brooklyn, NY. The analysis will examine data from NYC Parks on street trees and census data on median household income and population. The correlation of these datasets with land surface temperature, measured through Google Earth Engine, will be explored to gain a deeper understanding of the issue.
